DATA MODEL: describe real world properties and relations

--> important to organize data
--> organized data determines later data use
--> begin prior to build applications, business logic and analytics
--> iterative process

RELATIONAL MODEL: data in tables, with unique key identifying each row

RELATIONAL DATABASE: software system to maintain different data models

--> MySQL
--> PostgreSQL
--> Oracle
--> MSSQL

--> easy to use
--> ability to joins
--> aggregations and analytics
--> smaller data volumes
--> flexibility of queries
--> ACID

DATABASE SCHEMA: collection of tables

TABLE/RELATIONS: group of rows sharing the same labeled elements

ACID PROPERTIES:

--> Atomicity
--> Consistency
--> Isolation
--> Durability

WHEN NOT TO USE RELATIONAL DATABASE:

--> large amount of data
--> different type of formats
--> need flexible schema
--> need high availability
--> need horizontal scaling

POSTGRESQL

--> open source relational database system
--> uses and builds on language
